BrewMaster lets you manage and display your beers and batches.

== Description ==

BrewMaster adds beer and batch management to Wordpress with the homebrewer in mind.

Beers and batches are managed in the admin interface and can be simply displayed in the frontend with shortcodes.  Each beer/batch has its own Wordpress page and the full list can be automatically display with a simple shortcode: [BrewMaster:list].

Or if you prefer you can use the indiviual shortcodes to display chosen beers and/or batches.  [BrewMaster:beer id=#] and [BrewMaster:batch id=#]

=== Planned Features ===

* Untappd integration - Full integration for your beers from Untappd.

== Installation ==

Simply upload the BrewMaster directory to your plugins folder and activate it as usual on the plugins page in the admin interface.  Check out the BrewMaster>Options page (in the admin interface) for some basic configuration stuff like your brewery name and use the Add Beer link to get started!
